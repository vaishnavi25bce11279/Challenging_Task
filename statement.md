# ScholarSphere-Python based FAQ ChatBot

## Problem Statement:
Navigating technology learning resources and troubleshooting programming issues is often time-consuming and scattered across multiple platforms. Users, especially beginners, face difficulties finding clear, concise, and categorized answers to common technical questions about software setup, development environments, version control, and troubleshooting. There is a need for an easy-to-use interactive tool to quickly access curated FAQs and answers to accelerate learning and problem resolution.
## Project Objective

ScholarSphere aims to implement a modular, console-based chatbot that instantly answers frequently-asked questions (FAQs) on Python development, software installation, coding tools, and troubleshooting. The system provides efficient access to curated solutions, enabling students to overcome setup barriers and learn more effectively.
## Functional Requirements

Display a main menu with options: browse categories, search questions, exit.
Show all questions within a selected category and return answers on request.
Enable users to search for questions by entering keywords.
Guide the user back to menu with easy navigation and error handling.
Provide helpful feedback when invalid choices or keywords are entered.

## Non-functional Requirements

Console-based interface-compatible with all major operating systems, no GUI required.
In-memory data storage-no internet connection or external dependencies.
Modularity-distinct files for UI, logic, data, and configuration for maintainability.
Comprehensive code comments and documentation for educational clarity.

## Scope of the Project:
This project builds a text-based FAQ chatbot application that provides categorized, searchable answers related to software installation, file/folder setup, virtual environments, Git/GitHub, common errors, and development tools. It covers foundational programming and development topics relevant for learners and developers. The scope includes developing a console interface, implementing navigation menus for browsing categories and questions, keyword-based search, and clear presentation of answers.

## Target Users:
1.Computer Science and IT students.
2.Beginner to intermediate programmers.
3.Learners setting up development environments.
4.Developers troubleshooting common issues.
5.Anyone seeking quick answers on software installation, Python setup, and Git usage.

## High-level Features:
1.Browse FAQ categories and questions via a menu-driven interface.
2.Keyword search to find relevant questions across categories.
3.Display clear, formatted answers to FAQ questions.
4.Isolated modular code design with configuration, UI display, chat management, and main app control.
5.Easy extensibility to add new categories and questions.
6.User-friendly error handling and input validation.
7.Console-based experience suitable for educational environments.
